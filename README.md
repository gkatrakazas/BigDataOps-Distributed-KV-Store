# BigDataOps - Distributed Key-Value Store with Query Engine

Welcome to BigDataOps, a powerful and scalable solution for managing big data and executing complex queries in a distributed environment. This project showcases a robust key-value store system and a query engine designed for big data sets.

## Overview
BigDataOps consists of two main components:

1. **Data Creation:** The data generation script (`genData.py`) generates synthetic data with nested structures, creating a dataset for testing and experimentation.

2. **Key-Value Store and Query Engine:** The key-value store and query engine are implemented in Python, utilizing a distributed architecture across multiple servers (`server1.py`, `server2.py`, `server3.py`). The client (`kvClient.py`) interacts with the servers to perform various operations, including GET, DELETE, QUERY, and complex COMPUTE operations.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run BigDataOps: 1. **Generate Synthetic Data:** 
```
python3 genData.py -k keyFile.txt -n 100 -d 3 -l 4 -m 5
```
This command generates synthetic data for your testing needs.

 -  **Start Servers:**
    
    -   Start server1:
	    ```
	     python3 server1.py -a 127.0.0.1 -p 5001`
	    ```
	   
	 - Start server2: 
        ```
        python3 server2.py -a 127.0.0.1 -p 5002` 
        ```
    -   Start server3:        
        ```
        python3 server3.py -a 127.0.0.1 -p 5003` 
        ```
3.  **Index Data:**
    ```
    python3 kvClient.py -s serverFile.txt -i dataToIndex.txt -k 2` 
    ```
    This command indexes the generated data across the servers.
    
4.  **Interact with the Key-Value Store:** Use the client (`kvClient.py`) to interact with the key-value store and query engine. You can perform operations like GET, DELETE, QUERY, and complex COMPUTE operations.
    
 ## Example Executions

Here are some example interactions with the BigDataOps system:

-   Retrieving a value:  
    ```
    Enter Question: GET key1
    Received Answer: key1 -> [ "level" -> [ "height" -> 80.38 | "name" -> "oq" | " level" -> 26 ] | "height" -> [ "name" -> "uk" | " age" -> 18 | "level" -> 89 | "height" -> 10.56 | "street" -> "fo" ] | " age" -> [ "street" -> "r" | "height" -> 59.67 | "age" -> 45 | "level" -> 7 ] | "street" -> [] | "name" -> [ "street" -> "fopv" | " height" -> 43.01 ] ]
    ```
    
-   Deleting a key:  
    ```Enter Question: DELETE key1
    Received Answer: key1 -> OK
    ```
-   Complex query and computation:
    ```Enter Question: COMPUTE log(x)+tan(y)-2x WHERE x = QUERY key3.height.level AND y = QUERY key10.age.level
    Received Answer: -332.21845269437216
    ``` 

 ## Handling Server Failures

BigDataOps gracefully handles server failures. It checks the availability of servers before sending queries and provides appropriate error messages when servers are down.
